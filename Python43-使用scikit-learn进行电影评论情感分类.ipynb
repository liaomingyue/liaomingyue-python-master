      "<class 'sklearn.utils.Bunch'> b\"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse . \\nit's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? \\nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . \\nin this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . \\nwith the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! \\nparts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . \\nyes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . \\nanyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie . \\nit just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . \\nsure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . \\nit's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . \\naside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . \\ni'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . \\nspeaking of action , where was it in this film ? \\nthere was hardly any explosions or fights . \\nthe devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt . \\nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . \\ni was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . \\ni also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much . \\nthere was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . \\nthe budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . \\nit's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . \\ndo they even read these things anymore ? \\nit sure doesn't seem like it . \\nthankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film . \\nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . \\nthe guy is creepy looking anyway ! \\nwhen it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie . \\ndon't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action . \\nit's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . \\nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . \\n\"\n",
